I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at Tiangong University, China. I earned a B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Huaibei Normal University (2016–2020). During the same period, I pursued a minor in Accounting and earned a B.M. degree (2017–2020). Since 2022, I have been pursuing my Master’s degree in Mathematics at Tiangong University. In 2024, I transitioned to the combined Master-PhD program. Professor [Jinzhi Lei](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jinzhi-Lei/research) supervises me.

Main research interests and directions
======
My research focuses on the intersection of applied mathematics and life sciences, particularly employing mathematical modeling and quantitative approaches to investigate complex systems in biomedicine. Currently, my project focuses on **mathematical modeling and quantitative analysis of tumor-immune interactions**. I am particularly interested in integrating theoretical models with experimental/clinical data to uncover tumor immune evasion mechanisms through mathematical modeling, thereby providing quantitative decision support for precision medicine.
