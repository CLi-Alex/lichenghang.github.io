I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Tiangong University, China.

I earned a B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the School of Mathematical Sciences at Huaibei Normal University (2016–2020). During the same period, I pursued a minor in Accounting at the School of Economics and Management of the same university and earned a B.M. degree (2017–2020). Since 2022, I have been pursuing my Master’s degree in Mathematics at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Tiangong University. In 2024, I transitioned to the combined Master-PhD program. Professor [Jinzhi Lei](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jinzhi-Lei/research) supervises me.

Main research interests and directions
======
My research focuses on the intersection of applied mathematics and life sciences, particularly employing mathematical modeling and quantitative approaches to investigate complex systems in biomedicine. Currently, my project focuses on mechanistic modeling and quantitative analysis of tumor-immune interactions. I am particularly interested in integrating theoretical models with experimental/clinical data to uncover tumor immune evasion mechanisms through mathematical modeling, thereby providing quantitative decision support for precision medicine.
